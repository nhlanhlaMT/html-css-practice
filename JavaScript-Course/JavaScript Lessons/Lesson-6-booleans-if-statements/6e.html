  <!-- 6e. Continuing from exercise 6d, let's say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;
• Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.
• Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use brackets () to control which code gets done first.
• Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages. -->

<script> 
  const age = 5;
  const isHoliday = true;

  if ((age <= 6 || age >= 65) && !isHoliday) {
    console.log('Discount')
  } else {
    console.log('No Discount!');
  }
